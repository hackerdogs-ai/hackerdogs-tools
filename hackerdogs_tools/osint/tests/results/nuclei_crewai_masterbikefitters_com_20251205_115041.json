Detects CVEs, misconfigurations, and security issues. Best practices: Use rate limiting to avoid overwhelming targets, filter by severity to focus on critical issues, and use specific templates for targeted scanning.\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:\n\n```\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take, only one name of [Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner], just the name, exactly as it's written.\nAction Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \" to wrap keys and values.\nObservation: the result of the action\n```\n\nOnce all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:\n\n```\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\n```"
