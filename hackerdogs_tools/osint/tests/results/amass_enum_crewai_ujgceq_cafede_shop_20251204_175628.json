The system consistently reports errors related to invalid flags being used, though I am not explicitly passing any invalid flags in my inputs. This suggests there may be an issue with how the Amass tool is being invoked or executed within this specific OSINT framework. To properly complete this task, a working Amass environment with proper flag support would be required to enumerate subdomains for the target domain.",
